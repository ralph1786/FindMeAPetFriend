The application is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It also uses webpack for bundling and babel to compile code to ES5 or earlier.

### Getting Started

You need to obtain an API key from https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs

In index.js file replace the variable _petFinderApiKey_ with your own API key from [petfinder][https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs].

Once you have cloned the project into you computer, open the terminal and write the following command:

```
npm install
```

This will install the dependencies necessary for the application to work.

To run the application we use the _webpack-dev-server_ package by typing the following command on your terminal:
